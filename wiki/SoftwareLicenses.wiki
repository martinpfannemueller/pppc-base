#summary A brief discussion of software licenses.

= Introduction =

I am not a lawyer and I do not want to be one. If there are legal issues with the contents of the repository or the web page, please contact me via mailto:marcus.handte@googlemail.com before contacting your lawyer. Without further ado, I will gladly remove whatever is necessary to make you happy. 

I have tried to remove all code and as many resources as possible that were not created by me (or someone from my team) but chances are that I have missed something and if there is some artifact created by you, please let me know, so I can remove it from the repository or add the corresponding license to this page.

= The Intention =

Until recently, the BASE code that you find in this repository was solely used internally within a couple of research projects. Since the code has become more mature over time, we would like to share the results with everyone for free without strings attached. 

= Our License =

Consequently, we have decided to use a BSD license for everything developed by us. By using our code, you accept the following:

In general, this license applies to all code that you can find within the packages under *info.pppc*. Note that this does not include the image resources as they are - for the most part - taken from Eclipse and adapted to display nicely on a WM6 device.

Furthermore, this also does not apply to the code that you can find in the vendor subfolder which - at the moment - contains a copy of the Bouncycastle 1.46 lightweight API. The reason for including this code in the repository at all is the lack of a Maven build for this specific distribution of Bouncycastle.

= Other Licenses =

As stated previously, the image resources contained in the swt and lcdui packages are adapted icons from the Eclipse distribution which is - to the best of my knowledge - distributed under the [http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html Eclipse Public License].

The bouncycastle code is - to the best of my knowledge - distributed under an [http://www.bouncycastle.org/licence.html MIT X11 License] but apparently, there are also patents on some of the algortihms in case they are used in commercial products.

The SunSPOT libraries - to which the SunSPOT related subprojects are linking - are - to the best of my knowledge - licensed under the [http://java.net/projects/spots-network-library/ GNU Public License V2]. Consequently, you might not be able to use them in a commerical closed source application - but again, I am not lawyer.

The CLDC and MIDP stubs - that are used to compile most of the code in such a way that it executes everywhere - are - to the best of my knowledge - licensed under the [http://mcpat.github.com/java-microedition-libraries/ GNU Lesser Public License V3.0].

The Bluecove library - that is used to compile the JSR-82 Bluetooth plug-in and included in the Bluetooth example projects - is - to the best of my knowledge - licensed under [http://bluecove.org/ Apache License, V2].

= Disclaimer =

The above description may not be correct, so please re-check this to be sure. I am trying to be exact here but I cannot take responsibility for whatever happens if there is a flaw.
