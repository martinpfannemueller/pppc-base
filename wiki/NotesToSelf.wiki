#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

The notes below are probably only useful for me but as I know that I will not remember the specific details of the solutions below, I rather write them down. 

= Eclipse Update Site vs. Tycho =

Tycho relies on P2 repositories. Thus, it requires a proper version of artifacts.xml and contents.xml on the update site. This command line can generate the two files from a local copy of the update site:

{{{
java -jar C:/Progra~1/Java/Eclipse*/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_*.jar 
  -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.publisher.FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher 
  -metadataRepository file:///c:/sitecopy 
  -artifactRepository file:///c:/sitecopy
  -source c:/sitecopy 
  -publishArtifacts
}}}

Once the metadata is updated, it is *important to clear out the cache* in the local maven repository. Otherwise, the problem persists.

= Eclipse PDE vs. Target Platform =

When working on the Eclipse plug-ins, PDE will not automatically chose the proper target platform definition. *It seems necessary to manually switch between definitions using the Eclipse preference dialog.* Changes to target definitions are only reflected after switching from one to another and back. The reload button seems not to work properly.
