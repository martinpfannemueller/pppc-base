#summary A brief description of the available BASE plug-ins.

= Introduction =

This page contains a list of the available BASE plug-ins that are part of the distribution. All plug-ins are strictly optional, however, in order to be useful, BASE requires at least one complete stack of plug-ins. A complete stack usually encompasses a discovery plug-in, a transceiver plug-in, a serializer plug-in and a semantic plug-in. 

In addition, the page also lists a number of ultility classes that can simplify the development of additional plug-ins. The utility classes primarily focus on connection multiplexing and group-based communication.

= Plug-ins =

The list below outlines all plug-ins that are part of the BASE distribution to date. The plug-ins are distributed over a set of projects to simplify compilation for different platforms.

= Utilities =

The *BASE Core* project and the *BASE Plug-in* project contain a number of utility classes that simplify plug-in development. All utility classes adhere to the J2ME CLDC specification and do not introduce further dependencies.

|| *Project* || *Name* || *Type* || *Descripton* ||
|| BASE Core || FragmentConnector || Connector || A connector that provides fragmentation for packets that exceed the length of the underlying connector. ||
|| BASE Core || GroupConnector || Connector || A connector that multiplexes a single connector into different groups by attaching an additional header. ||
|| BASE Plug-in || FloodConnector || Connector || A connector that implements scoped flooding of packets sent via the connector. ||
|| BASE Plug-in || TimeoutConnector || Connector || A connector that implements a simple synchronization protocol for unbuffered connections. ||
|| BASE Plug-in || MultiplexFactory || Multiplexer || A multiplexer that can multiplex a single stream to provide connection-oriented and packet-based communication over it. ||
