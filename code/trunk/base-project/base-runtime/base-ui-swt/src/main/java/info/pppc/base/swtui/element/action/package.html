This package contains generic actions that seem
to be useful for many elements. The refresh action
can be used to enable the user to manually refresh
a refreshable element. The remove action can be
used to enable the user removing the currently
focused element. In order to use these actions,
a programmer must simply return them in the get
menu action method of the element.
