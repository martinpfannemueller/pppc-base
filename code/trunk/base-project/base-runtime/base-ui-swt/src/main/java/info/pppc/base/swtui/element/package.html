This package contains the extension model supported by
the application. As described in the documentation of
the main package of the base swt ui, the application
can be extended with multiple tabs by adding so-called
elements. 
</p>
<p>
An element has a manager which is called element manager. 
The element manager can be used to synchronize on the user 
interface thread and it can be used to focus/add/remove 
other elements. Furthermore, the application enables the 
elements to show a progress bar in the application window 
whenever a long-running operation takes place.
