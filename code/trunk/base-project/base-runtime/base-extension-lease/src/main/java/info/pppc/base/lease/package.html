This package contains the base lease registry. This registry
can be used to manage leases. Leases itself are used to manage
soft-state. Note that this package is completely optional. You
can remove it at will to reduce the size of base.
</p>
<p>
The general idea is that whenever a server creates state for a 
client, it issues a lease. This lease can be created by calling 
the create method on the local lease registry. The lease itself 
is serializable and can be sent directly through base. To create
the lease, the server passes a listener to the lease registry.
If the lease expires, the listener will be called and the server
can remove its state.
</p>
<p>
Whenever a client gets a lease from a server, it registeres the
lease at its local lease registry using the hook method. The lease 
contains all necessary data, such as timeouts, device ids, and so on. 
Together with the lease, the client passes a listener to the registry.
This listener will be called, whenever the server is no longer
available and does no longer have the state.
</p>
<p>
After the state is no longer used by the client, the client or 
the server can simply unhook the lease. Thereby, they can decide
whether they want the lease registry to send a notification to the
server or client.
