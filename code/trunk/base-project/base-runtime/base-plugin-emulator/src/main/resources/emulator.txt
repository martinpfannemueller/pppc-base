# This file is used by the MxIPEmulatorTransceiver
# It defines a scenario from devices and connections
#
# Devices are specified with the case-sensitive device 
# directive
# device.<NAME> = <IP/HOST>:<PORT> | <PORT>
#
# Connections are specified with the case-sensitive connect 
# directive
# connect = <NAME>:<NAME>
#
# Devices appearing in the connections directive must have
# been declared earlier in a corresponding device directive 
#
# Note that the devices are treated in order, devices
# that appear latter in the file will establish the
# connection to devices that appear earlier. This means
# that (!) if you distribute the file to several
# hosts the device ordering MUST REMAIN THE SAME
#
# The following example specifies three devices that are
# forming a chain:
#
# device.A = 10001
# device.B = localhost:10002
# device.C = basic.cs.uni-bonn.de:10003
# connect = A:B
# connect = B:C
#
# Now comes the real scenario

device.A = 10001
device.B = 10002
device.C = 10003
connect = A:B
connect = B:C
