This package contains transceiver plug-ins. Transceiver plug-ins provide
connection-oriented bi-directional communication as well as unreliable
packet-based communication with broadcast semantics for different
communication technologies. Intuitively, transceiver plug-ins are platform
dependent as they require different libraries to access the associated
communication technology.
</p>
<p>
At the present time, we support the following transceiver plug-ins:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MxIPEmulatorTransceiver - An IP-based plug-in that emulates a
	specific network topology on top of a fully connected IP network.</li>
<li>MxBluetoothTransceiver - A Bluetooth-based transceiver plug-in
	that uses one connection per device that is multiplexed to
	support an arbitrary number of streams.</li>
<li>IPBroadcastTransceiver - An IP-based transceiver that uses IP
	broadcast for distributing packets. The use of this transceiver
	is discouraged as it cannot be used multiple times on the same
	device. Use the multicast-based transceiver instead.</li>
<li>IPMulticastTransceiver - An IP-based transceiver that uses IP
	multicast for distributing packets.</li>
<li>IPMxBroadcastTransceiver - A multiplexed variant of the IPBroadcastTransceiver.
	The use of this plug-in should be preferred over the simple
	IPBroadcastTransceiver as this one should be faster due to
	connection multiplexing.</li>
<li>IPMxMulticastTransceiver - A multiplexed variant of the IPMulticastTransceiver.
	This plug-in should be used as default for IP-based networks
	as it is faster than the IPMulticastTransceiver and it also
	uses multicast for packet distribution.</li>
<li>MxIRTransceiver - A multiplexed transceiver that uses IrDA
	via Winsock. The native libraries are available for Windows
	and Windows CE.</li>
<li>MxSerialTransceiver - A multiplexed transceiver that uses serial
	connections for communication. Note that there are two versions
	available (one for sunspots and one for other devices).</li>
<li>MxSpotTransceiver - A multiplexed transceiver that uses the
	protocols provided by the sunspot sdk to support wireless
	communication.</li>
</ul>
