This package contains the console implementation. The
console can be used to redirect the output stream of
the base logging facility to some graphical element.
As most vms on mobile phones redirect the standard
output and error streams directly to nirvana, this is
the only method to enable the user to see what an
application is doing without programming a user interface.
Note that the console can only be used to redirect the
logging facility, thus all calls to system out will
be lost in nirvana.
