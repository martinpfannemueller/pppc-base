This package contains an exemplary service that demonstrates 
application development with BASE. The class that contains the main
method is RMIMain. The main method shows how to bootstrap a simple
version of BASE with a set of plug-ins and one service. The application
itself performs a continuous discovery and tries to find other services
with the same interface. If it finds other services, it calls the remote
print function to display a string.
</p>
<p>
Plug-ins are installed by calling the <code>addPlugin(...)</code> method 
on the <code>PluginManager</code> that is retrieved through the singleton
instance of the <code>InvocationBroker</code>. The default set of plug-ins
consists of a semantic plug-in, a serializer plug-in and a transceiver 
plug-in with a corresponding discovery plug-in.
</p>
<p>
Services are installed by registering them at a local instance of the
<code>ServiceRegistry</code>. Apart from the service's invocation handler,
and its exported interfaces, additional properties can be specified to 
describe the service in more detail.
</p>
<p>
The skeleton and proxy for the service can be generated automatically 
using the BASE eclipse plug-in. To generate these stubs, select the
desired interface and right-click it in the package explorer. From
the "3PC Base Tools" menu select "Generate Stubs". This will create
a "<Interface>Proxy.java" and "<Interface>Skeleton.java" file in the
same package.
