This package contains the non functional framework. The framework can be used
by applications to gain manual control with varying degrees of freedom over the plug-in
composition performed by the plug-in manager. The application developer can create
a collection and add it to its invocation before it is sent to some remote system. 
Thereby the developer can add requirements for different plug-in layers. This will 
cause the plug-in manager to either prefer a certain plug-in over another or to signal 
a failure if the composition does not adhere to the described stack configuration.
