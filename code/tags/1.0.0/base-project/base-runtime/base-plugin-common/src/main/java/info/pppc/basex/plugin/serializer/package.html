This package contains serializer plugins. Serializer plugins are used serialize
objects. Although its not neccessary to have such a plugin, in general, it is
required for all semantic plugins that are currently provided as part of base.
</p>
<p>
Note that all plugins contained in this package are completely optional. You can delete
them at will to reduce the size of base.
