This package contains modifier plug-ins. Modifier plug-ins are used to change
the transmitted byte sequence. Examples could be plug-ins that perform 
encryption or plug-ins that compress the transmitted bytes. BASE can operate
without such plug-ins.
</p>
<p>
At the present time, we provide the following plug-ins:
</p>
<ul>
<li>GZIPCompressor - A compression plug-in based on the gzip output stream
	of the J2SE api.</li>
<li>SecureModifier - A modifier plug-in that encrypts and authenticates 
	stream-based communication using the BASE security extensions.</li>
</ul>
