This package contains the base lcdui user interface. This user
interface is intended for mobile phones. The main class of the 
user interface is called application. It can be started by calling 
the static get instance method in the base ui class. This will 
spawn a new user interface thread and it will initialize the 
invocation broker.
</p>
<p>
The application supports two types of extensions, namely
actions and elements. Actions are added using the
add/remove contribution methods of the application. Elements
are added using the add/remove/focus element methods.
</p>
<p>
Actions are shown as menu items in the launcher menu in the order 
in which they have been added to the application. Using actions, 
elements can be created and added on demand.
</p>
<p>
Elements are added as views that are accessible from the launcher
menu. In the launcher menu, a user can chose the view that he
wants to focus. Using the focus element method, the focus can
also be put manually onto a certain element. Each element
has its own menu that is brought up whenever the element is 
focused. Apart from the actions defined by the element, the 
menu will always contain an action that enables the user to jump
back to the launcher view.
</p>
<p>
The base lcd ui provides a small set of simple debugging tools. 
These tools can be added by adding the corresponding action to the
system menu. The action that enables these tools is called system
action. A simple way to add the action to the current application
is to call the register system browser method in the base ui class.
Adding this action will enable the user to bring up the
so-called system browser. 
</p>
<p>
Using the system browser, a user can see the devices that are currently 
available. In contrast to the base swt ui, the base lcdu does not
provide a service browser. However, since the service browser provided
by the swt ui can also be used to browse services on remote devices,
this functionality can be executed on some other device.
