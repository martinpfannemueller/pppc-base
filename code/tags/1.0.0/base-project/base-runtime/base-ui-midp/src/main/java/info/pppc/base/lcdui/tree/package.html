This package contains a tree widget that enables
a developer to create a tree view. The tree uses
tree nodes as internal data model. A tree node can
be selectable. If it is selectable, the user interface
will contain a select action that lets the user
select the action. If the action is selected, an
event is fired. Whenever the selection in the tree
changes an event is fired too.
