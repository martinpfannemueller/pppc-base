This package contains a custom widget toolkit. The
toolkit is a drop in replacement for the lcdui
toolkit contained in the midlet profile. We use this
toolkit instead of the original version since the
implementation on the Nokia S60 series contains
lots of bugs.
</p>
<p>
The toolkit itself is intended to be single threaded,
however, as we cannot control the threading used by
the underlying toolkit implementation, some methods
(such as the paint method) might be called from a 
non-gui thread. Thus, all items should synchronize on
the global ui lock whenever the internal state is
manipulated. 
</p>
<p>
The display thread can be created and retrieved through
the form display. The form display enables synchronous
and asynchronous postings of events. The form is the
main class that provides a layout algorithm and a repaint
handler for the items (i.e. widgets) contained on the
form.
</p>
<p>
Commands and key events are always posted to items using
the ui thread. Thus, whenever a command or key event is
handled, all other gui operations are blocked. Since the
threading of the underlying implementation cannot be 
controlled, this does not mean that other methods are 
also not called. Especially the repaint method may be
called at any point in time.
