This package contains the generator of the base eclipse plugin.
The generator can be used to create stubs (i.e., proxies and
skeletons) for interfaces contained in eclipse. The generator
uses templates to generate code. Furthermore, it uses a formatting
writer to generate nice looking java source code. More complex
parsing of interfaces and the generation of java files using
eclipse are pushed into the java utility.
