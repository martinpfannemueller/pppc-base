This package contains an exemplary service that demonstrates 
application development with BASE. The class that contains the main
method is StreamMain. The main method shows how to bootstrap a simple
version of BASE with a set of plug-ins and one service. The application
itself performs a continuous discovery and tries to find other services
with the same interface.

<p>
In contrast to the RMI example, the stream example shows the streaming
interface that enables applications to establish low-level connections.
To do this, the service must declare the IStreamHandler interface. When
detecting this interface, the BASE Eclipse plug-in will generate a 
proxy with special code to initiate a connection. Note that the 
connection establishment requires an appropriate streaming plug-in
which needs to be installed on all interacting systems.
