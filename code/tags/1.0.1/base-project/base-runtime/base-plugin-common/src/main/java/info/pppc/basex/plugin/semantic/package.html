This package contains semantic plug-ins. Semantic plug-ins are used to perform
synchronization and retransmission control. In order to enable the various
types of invocation semantics supported by base, you will need corresponding
semantic plug-ins. 
</p>
<p>
At the present time, we provide the following plug-ins:
</p>
<ul>
<li>RMISemantic - A duplex semantic for synchronous and asynchronous invocations
	that performs retransmissions.</li>
<li>StreamSemantic - A semantic for stream-based transmission. Invocations are
	solely used for signaling of incoming streams.</li>
<li>ExchangeSemantic - A semantic that performs key exchange using the security
	extensions of BASE.</li>
</ul>
