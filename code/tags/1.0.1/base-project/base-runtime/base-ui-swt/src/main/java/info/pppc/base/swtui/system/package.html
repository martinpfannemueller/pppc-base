This package contains the system browser. As described in
the main package of the swt ui, the system browser can be
used to see which devices are currently available. The
service browser lists the installed plug-ins and the 
installed well known base services. Using the system browser,
a user can startup the service browser on devices that are
equipped with a base service registry.
