This package contains the base swt user interface. This user
interface is intended for desktop pcs and pocket pcs. The
main class of the user interface is called application. It
can be started by calling the static get instance method in
the base ui class. This will spawn a new user interface thread 
and it will initialize the invocation broker.
</p>
<p>
The application supports two types of extensions, namely
actions and element controls. Actions are added using the
add/remove contribution methods of the application. Elements
are added using the add/remove/focus element methods.
</p>
<p>
Actions are shown as menu items in the system menu in the order 
in which they have been added to the application. Using actions, 
elements can be created and added on demand.
</p>
<p>
Elements are added as tabs. A user can chose the tab that he
wants to focus. Using the focus element method, the focus can
also be put manually onto a certain element. Each element
has its own menu that is brought up whenever the element is 
focused. The menu is called view and it is shown together with
the system menu that contains the actions that are always available.
</p>
<p>
The base swt ui provides a small set of simple debugging tools. 
These tools can be added by adding the corresponding action to the
system menu. The action that enables these tools is called system
action. A simple way to add the action to the current application
is to call the register system browser method in the base ui class.
Adding this action will enable the user to bring up the
so-called system browser. 
</p>
<p>
Using the system browser, a user can see the devices that are currently 
available. If a device is equipped with a base service registry, the 
user can right-click the device and bring up the service registry 
browser. Using this browser, the user can create and execute queries. 
Additionally, the user can create simple invocations manually and he can
transmit them to some service.
