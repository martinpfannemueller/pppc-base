This package contains the security extensions for base. The extensions
consist primarily of a number of abstractions for certificate and
key management as well as base classes for secure communications.
The sub packages contain helper classes for different types of
cryptographic mechanisms.

<p>
To use the security extensions, it is necessary to initialize the key
store as the first call in the main program. The invocation broker
will then use the fingerprint of the certificate that is used to
identify the device as a unique (hard to forge) device identifier.
