This package contains the element definitions that can
be used to extend the base lcd ui with additional
screens. The screens that are currently open are listed
in the launcher screen. Using the launcher action which
will be available at all times, a user can decide to 
jump to the launcher and then select any other element
that is currently part of the user interface.
