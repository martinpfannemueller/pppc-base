This package contains the base eclipse plugin. The base eclipse
plugin can be used to generate stubs (i.e., proxies and skeletons)
for interfaces that are accessible in the eclipse ide. The 
plugin class itself (which is the only class contained in this
package) is used to access common resources such as the property
file of the plugin. The property file contains all strings used
in the user interface as well as the class names of classes that
are used during code generation.
