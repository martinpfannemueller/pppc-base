This package contains an simple example for object serialization in
BASE. Similar to the RMI example, this example defines a service 
that is exported via the registry. The service is defined as SerialService.
Instead of using a string in the print method, the interface of the
service uses a user defined object called SerialObject.
</p>
<p>
To enable object serialization, each serializable object must implement
the ISerializable interface defined in the io package of the BASE core.
In addition, it needs to provide a public default constructor. When
implementing ISerializable, the developer must provide a readObject and
a writeObject method that read/write the internal state of the object to
the passed input and output streams. This is very similar to Java
serialization, however, it must be done explicitly since access to
internal fields is not possible on small devices.

For more details on serialization read the documentation provided by
the object input and output streams in the io package of the BASE
core.
