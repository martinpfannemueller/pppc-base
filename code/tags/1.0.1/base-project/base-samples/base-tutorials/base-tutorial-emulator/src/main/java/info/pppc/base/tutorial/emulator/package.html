This package contains an simple example for the emulator plug-in. The 
emulator plug-in uses the scenario.txt file to read its configuration.
The scenario defines 4 devices that are connected in a cycle. The
application itself reuses the RMI example which exports a service on
each device and queries for it continuously. If a service is found,
the print method is called. For more details see the RMI example.
</p>
<p>
In order to run this demo, you need to start the EmulatorMain class
4 times. Notice that each application instance will pick its own 
configuration from the scenario depending on the order in which it 
is started. You may kill and restart any instance. The emulator 
plug-in will simply restart them and reconnect them as you would
expect.

<p>
Even though not all devices are connected directly to each other,
each device will find all remote services as the example installs
a routing plug-in as well. You may remove the routing plug-in by
commenting the line <code>m.addPlugin(new ProactiveRouting());</code>.
