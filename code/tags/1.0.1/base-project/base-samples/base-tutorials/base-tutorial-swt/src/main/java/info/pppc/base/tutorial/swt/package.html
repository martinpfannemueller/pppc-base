This package contains an exemplary service that demonstrates 
application development with BASE. The class that contains the main
method is UiMain. The main method shows how to bootstrap a simple
version of BASE with a set of plug-ins and one service. To do this,
the application simply reuses the RMI example. In addition, it also
enables the SWT based user interface.
</p>
<p>
To use the user interface, it is necessary to reference the corresponding
project. Furthermore, it is necessary to instantiate the ui. This can
be done by calling the getInstance method in the application class, i.e.
<code>Application.getInstance();</code>. This opens the application 
window and by default, it also redirects the logging streams to the
console window. 
</p>
<p>
By calling <code>BaseUI.registerSystemBrowser();</code> in addition,
the system will register the system browser extension into the user
interface. The system browser enables the user to query the service
registries on devices that are equipped with it. Furthermore, it 
can be used to dynamically call methods on services.
